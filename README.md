## Why Toast-E?

What if I told you there was a toaster that could never burn toast?

Why simply use a timer, when your toaster can be so much smarter?

Frustrated with unpredictable toast, and a total lack of innovation in the kitchen space, Baker-E, founded by an exceptional team of McMaster Mechatronics Engineering students, is excited to introduce their flagship product, Toast-E, the first toaster that combines intelligent control with a user-friendly design, ensuring perfectly toasted slices, every single time.
